# Rust-Vue-osoauth

This is a Rust/Vue based project. This project shows how to use [Oso](osohq.com) for Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) authorization. The article that best explains how I was able to come up with this project can be found [here](https://hannydevelop.hashnode.dev/role-based-access-control-with-oso-rust-and-vuejs-ckiy2x3mq0u7e33s16g30hp7i). I give credit to the team who developed the [Rust-Oso quick start](https://github.com/osohq/oso-rust-quickstart), the inspiration for this project was drawn from there. I also thank the wonderful oso team for letting me try out this wonderful open source product and writing an article based on my end user experience.

## Project Set Up

The root of this project consists of two folders (Backend and Frontend). The Backend holds the codes for Rust and Oso authorization while the Frontend holds the Vue.js codes.

```
npm install
